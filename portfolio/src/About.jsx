            I am an Applied Computer Science student at the University of Winnipeg. I love solving problems and 
            pciking my brain. Whether taking on new projects or
            solving LeetCode problems, I love to challenge myself. For fun, I love to play Call of Duty and watch
            crime or mystery shows.
